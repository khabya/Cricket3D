# Cricket3D

Cricket 3D is a basic OpenGL renderer with cover of all core basics(Drawing, Shaders, Texture, Camera, Lights, etc). I started using Gtk+ widgets but I get weird issues and so I moved to the QT widgets. And I used the Assimp library for loading 3d models. I tried to abstract the gui and render engine from the start. And that helped me a lot when I switched from the Gtk+ to the QT widgets.
